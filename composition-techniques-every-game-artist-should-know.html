    <h1>Composition Techniques Every Game Artist Should Know</h1>
    <p class="lead">Whether you’re creating a cinematic hero shot or a subtle background vignette, strong composition is the difference between art that reads instantly and art that confuses. This guide collects practical techniques that every game artist—whether working at a <a href="https://www.juegostudio.com/">video game development studio</a> or independently—should have in their toolkit.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Rule of Thirds (and Why It Works)</h2>
    <p>The rule of thirds divides the frame into a 3x3 grid. Placing points of interest on the intersections or along the lines creates natural balance and makes scenes feel intentional. For game art, use this for character placement, horizon lines, and major landmarks in a level thumbnail.</p>

    <h2>2. Strong Focal Point</h2>
    <p>Every composition needs a primary focal point—the thing the viewer should notice first. Establish it with contrast (light vs. dark), color accents, sharpness, or leading lines. Keep secondary elements muted so they don’t compete.</p>

    <h2>3. Leading Lines and Sight Paths</h2>
    <p>Leading lines guide the eye through the image: roads, beams of light, architectural features, or implied lines from a group of characters. In interactive scenes, use sight paths to suggest where the player should look or move next.</p>

    <h2>4. Value and Contrast First</h2>
    <p>Before worrying about color, block out values: darks, midtones, and lights. A composition that reads well in grayscale will usually work in color. Value is the fastest way to fix confusing scenes.</p>

    <h2>5. Silhouette and Readability</h2>
    <p>Characters and objects must read clearly at a glance. Strong silhouettes help readability in small thumbnails and gameplay cameras. Test designs by turning them into solid shapes—if the shape is readable, the design is strong.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <strong>Quick test:</strong> Shrink your concept to thumbnail size. If the hero, enemy, or important object reads instantly, you’re on the right track.
    </div>

    <h2>6. Depth Through Overlap and Atmospheric Perspective</h2>
    <p>Create depth by overlapping layers, varying sharpness, and using atmospheric perspective—objects further away should be less saturated and lighter in value. These techniques prevent flatness in wide environment shots.</p>

    <h2>7. Balance and Asymmetry</h2>
    <p>Symmetry can be powerful but predictable. Asymmetrical balance—where mass, color, and visual weight balance without mirroring—often feels more dynamic. Consider visual weight not only as size but as complexity, color, and contrast.</p>

    <h2>8. Color Harmony and Accent</h2>
    <p>Use a limited palette and pick one accent color to draw attention. Complementary accents (warm against cool) work reliably. But remember: color decisions should support value structure, not replace it.</p>

    <h2>9. Negative Space and Breathing Room</h2>
    <p>Negative space allows the focal point to breathe and helps readability. Don’t overcrowd every corner—use empty areas intentionally to highlight important elements and create tension or calm.</p>

    <h2>10. Rhythm, Repetition, and Variety</h2>
    <p>Repeating shapes or motifs creates rhythm, while small variations keep it interesting. Think of rhythm like music for the eye: a repeated silhouette can lead the player’s eye across a level, while a sudden break signals importance.</p>

    <h2>11. Scale and Proportion for Impact</h2>
    <p>Scale communicates narrative quickly. A tiny figure before a towering ruin says vulnerability. Use exaggerated scale to emphasize mood and gameplay mechanics—huge structures can hint at traversal opportunities or threats.</p>

    <h2>12. Camera and Framing Choices</h2>
    <p>Consider the camera’s role—first-person, third-person, isometric—and compose for that view. Cinematic close-ups emphasize character and emotion; wide establishing shots communicate space and objectives. Tailor compositions to the player’s viewpoint.</p>

    <h2>13. Iteration: Thumbnails, Roughs, and Polish</h2>
    <p>Start small. Thumbnail a dozen compositions quickly and pick the best two to refine. Iteration keeps you from overworking the wrong idea and helps discover stronger solutions faster—an essential workflow in any fast-paced studio environment.</p>

    <p>Mastering composition is both technical and intuitive—practice deliberately, study great concept artists and photographers, and always test at scale. Whether you’re designing a single splash image or the visual language of a level for a <a href="https://www.juegostudio.com/game-art-services">game art studio</a>, these techniques will help your work read faster, feel more purposeful, and better guide players through the experience.</p>
